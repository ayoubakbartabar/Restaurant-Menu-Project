**QR Menu** is a mobile-first web app that replaces traditional printed menus with a digital, touch-free experience. Each dining table receives a unique QR code that customers can scan to instantly access the restaurant’s menu on their smartphones.

👀 **What users can do:**
- 📋 Browse the full menu (food & drinks)
- 🔄 View real-time item availability
- 💬 Read customer reviews
- 🛒 (Optional) Place orders via the web interface

All this—without downloading any app.
