## üöÄ Project Overview

**QR Menu** is a mobile-first web app that replaces traditional printed menus with a digital, touch-free experience. Each dining table receives a unique QR code that customers can scan to instantly access the restaurant‚Äôs menu on their smartphones.

üëÄ **What users can do:**
- üìã Browse the full menu (food & drinks)
- üîÑ View real-time item availability
- üí¨ Read customer reviews
- üõí (Optional) Place orders via the web interface

All this‚Äîwithout downloading any app.
